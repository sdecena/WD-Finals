                    <h3>Interests:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a range of interests that keep me busy and happy. 
                        I love listening to MUSIC, whether it's finding new songs or 
                        playing my favorite playlists. Watching ANIME and SHOWS is 
                        something I really enjoy. Playing BASKETBALL is my way of staying active 
                        and having fun with friends. Lately, I've been learning to play
                        the DRUMS, which is a challenge but also really fun. And I like JOGGING to stay fit and clear
                        my head, it's peaceful and helps me relax after a busy day.
                        These hobbies all bring something special to my life, keeping me 
                        entertained and feeling good.

                    <h3>Skills:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a variety of skills that I've been building on. I know the 
                        basics of C++, which is useful for programming and problem-solving. 
                        I also have basic knowledge of PHOTOSHOP and ILLUSTRATOR, which helps me edit and 
                        create photos and logos. Understanding HTML and CSS allows me to create and 
                        customize web pages. Additionally, I have experience with VIDEO 
                        EDITING, which lets me put together and enhance videos for different 
                        purposes. These skills are a foundation that I'm continuing to develop 
                        and use in different projects.
